# [Florida Corrections Department Inmate Mortality Scraper](https://github.com/shirshod/fdc_inmatedeaths_scraper/blob/main/fdc_inmatedeaths_scraper.ipynb)

By: Shirsho Dasgupta (2021)


### Notes: 

The code extracts each row from the inmate mortality tables, then goes into the corresponding inmate profile page and extracts the demographic and custody details. 
The code searches for the "td" tag which stores the details on both mortality and inmate profile tables.

A sample spreadsheet generated by this scraper is attached. See inmate_deaths.csv
